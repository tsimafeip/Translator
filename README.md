Russian-Belarusian neural translator

The data is a part of my bachelor thesis about neural translation for the language pair Russian-Belarusian.

## Repository
The repo consists of
 - 429k aligned sentence pairs (under Data/AlignedData), split into 10 batches
 - chunks to align (under Data/ChunksToAlign)
 
- **Data/TabbedCorpusMiddleSent.txt** is a sample of 65966 sentences, at max 80 characters each, and is handy to train a model only on a sample of data.

 - neural network code.
